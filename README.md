# Kocoon-ver.2

We provide the latest information on wellbeing topics by working with charities, services and academics.

I designed and developed version 2.0 of the fully responsive website. This website uses HTML, SASS & Responsive Design.

This is takes a lot of work from version 1.0, but implemenets a few new desgin features (https://github.com/JoshuasProgramming/Kocoon) 

# Lessons Learned

Once again, I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the website that I had to make, via divide and conquer. Previously I had learnt the following:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that I made.
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design.
* Adding favicon to a page.
* Creating a website ASAP.
* Flexbox & layouts.

Now I've learn't:

* How to work with a UI/UX designer ad grab a few lessons from their side of work
* How to use Figma from a web developer point of view
* The process of updating an already exsisting website that I've made before
* The importance of commenting each section of code fully before writing HTML,CSS, SASS or Javasscript

# Challenges

* Making sure that when I decrease the height of the page, the elements don't adapt (responsive design)
* Updating my knowledge on responsive design as a whole.
* Looking for ways to minimise the amount of code that I write.
